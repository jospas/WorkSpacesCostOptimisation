	<h1 class="display-4">Amazon WorkSpaces Cost Optimisation</h1>

	<p class="lead">
		The Amazon WorkSpaces Cost Optimisation provides a detailed view of 
		Amazon WorkSpaces usage, providing customers with the insights required 
		to make decisions around cost optimisation.
	</p>

</div>

<div class="p-4">

	<p>
		Customers can now see which WorkSpace instances should be converted 
		between hourly and monthly billing modes and which idle instances should 
		be terminated. Simple predictions based on current usage within the 
		month are used to guide recommendations around billing mode conversions.
	</p>

	<p>
		It uses a scheduled AWS Lambda function to interrogate Amazon CloudWatch 
		metrics and stores daily usage in Amazon S3 for longitudinal 
		analysis.
